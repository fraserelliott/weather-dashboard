# challenge-5 Weeather App

Challenge for week 5 -

In this challenge, you will work as a team to produce a Weather Dashboard that utilizes the [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API. The goal is simple: when the user enters a location, the application converts it to a latitude and longitude, then makes a second API call to retrieve the current weather for that location.

IMPORTANT - NOTE -

# ALL CSS WORK and STYLING WORK HAS BEEN A JOINT COLLABORATION BETWEEN ISABELLE and JAMES - Working together through teams calls and submitting updates via GITHUB together. Github reflects this as a single person commiting these updates however this has been a combined effort throughout.

# Fraser has been working on the JavaScript.
