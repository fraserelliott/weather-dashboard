# challenge-2

Challenge for week 2 - Build a multipage web site using the skills learnt to far

The site is based around a ficticious store selling retro BMX bikes.

The design is based around CSS-Flex Box

Design Decisions

# Color Scheme

The primary colour used is a light blue which matches the Haro Brands color scheme, a manufacturer based in California. The colour to me represents blue skies and clear blue sea, providing a Californian feel.

The back ground colour is set to black as the constrasting with the blue and allows the use of light coloured fonts.
 Blue and Black are the colours used throughout all pages

# Navbar

The Nav bar has 4 text navigation links which are consistent accross all pages. The ideal number of links in the navbar is between 5 - 7, but can be less. The navbar on my page conforms with the preferred limit or a navbar structure and avoids over complicating the menu.

A brand log was created 'Branded BMX', this was designed to look like a brand stamp, uneven and patchy. This logo has been set to overlay the navbar to add layers and depth. The navbar also have a drop shadow applied to add further depth. The branded log also have a transform and transition effect, controlled be a media query. The idea is to maintain the overlay of teh brnaded logo ontop of the navbar. When the screen size shrinks the logo translates to a new position to avoid overlaying the navbar items. Therefore at the point of when the branded image clips the navbar menus text items the image is pushed down to below the navbar. The branded logo is set at an angle to make it look less structured, as you would expect from a branding stamp. It needed to appear more random and not conform to straight lines and tight box style. 

# Graphics

Various custom graphics have been created. The blue berm graphics in the footer breaks up the normal flat box style with straight lines. The white silouette bikes were added to provide a bit more interest to the page and contrast with the black background. 

The ICONS on the Store page that are within the cards were custom built. I added 3 coloured lines to help represent a reto colour scheme, typcial of the 1980's and added a text overlay to match with the navbar text. The users have options to follow the navabr or click on the buttons within the cards to navigate to the same place. The icons also have transform hover actions applied to add some animation to the screen. All pages that have icons have the same transform effects applied to maintain consitancy and add some small level of animiation which adds a bit more interest to the page.

I added flags icons to the cards on the 'Events' page, to make is easier/quicker to view the country locations and to makes the cards more interesting to look at, adding some colour. 

# Archives

The 'Archives' page displays a number of images. I set then within cards and added a border to make them look like physical photographs making them more interesting and to  add a vintage look and feel. Photos tend to be stored on phones nowadays and these are used to represent the past, before the digital revolution, which fits in with the retro image of this site. I have also added a transform to rotate the cards slightly and change the border colour of a card on hover. Just adding a bit of user interaction and animation to make it look more interesting.


# Future Considerations

'Navbar' - I look at add a navbrand or some image possibly one of the white silouetted bikes used in the footer into the navbar. To add a bit more interest the the navbar itself.

'Events' page - I would look to add colour to the cards or a background image, the white color looks ok but there is something missing. Id play around with this a bit more to make it look better.

'Store' - The actual cards are ok but to me not good enough. I do not like the table formatting, in terms of the colours and the font style. Id look to change these to make the cards look slicker and less clunky.

'Archives' - I would consider adding floating text boxes over each image with perhaps a brief description. Maybe use a script text to make it look like handwritten comments. 

Id maybe add a few videos on this page too.

Id like to have added a login and shopping cart function into the design.
