# challenge-5 Weeather App

Challenge for week 5 - 

In this challenge, you will work as a team to produce a Weather Dashboard that utilizes the [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API. The goal is simple: when the user enters a location, the application converts it to a latitude and longitude, then makes a second API call to retrieve the current weather for that location.
